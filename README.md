### **Goals**

Create a to-do list app using dynamically created objects, using factories or constructors/ classes to generate them.
Todo items will have the following properties: - title - description - dueDate - priority
The todo list will have Projects or separate lists of todos, starting with a 'default' project when the user first opens the app.

Users should be able to select which Project their todo items go into.

Application logic should be kept separate from DOM related stuff.

The interface should be able to do the following:

- View all projects
- View all todos in each project
- Expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- Delete a todo

Consider using the following:

- Webpack
- date-fns library
- localstorage

### **Positives**

### **Challenges**

1. Getting the organisation of the modules sorted out. I wanted to use MVC (Model-View-Controller) but found it tricky to get all modules in the right place and passing the right information around.

### **To Come Back To:**
Adding form validation as part of an upcoming assignment task
